Experimenting with random game themes


Currently Working on in terms of priority
1. Endpoint - level end condition
  i. When collide with end point -> parent playobj to endpoint -> transform endpoint into the void to make it seem like player is in elevator
  
2. Obstacles - objects that cause the player to lose health / lose the level
  i. some moving walls / enemies
  ii. spining trap / propellor
  iii. Gun trap
  
3. Score system
  i. coins 
  ii. shop?
